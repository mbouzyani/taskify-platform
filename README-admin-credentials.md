## Default Admin Account

After a fresh backend setup, the following admin credentials are available:

- **Email:** admin@taskify.com
- **Password:** Admin123!

These are seeded automatically if no admin user exists. Use them to log in via the API (e.g., Swagger UI at http://localhost:5217/swagger) after setup.

---

If you reset the backend and database, these credentials will be recreated.
